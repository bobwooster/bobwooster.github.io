# About

I'm a data scientist and mathematician.  My interests are (measure-theoretic) probability, stochastic processes, data science, and mathematical modelling.  I enjoy building [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) applications, agent-based models in [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), and simulations of random processes.

Here is my [CV](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/bobwooster/my_cv/raw/main/resume_wooster.pdf).

## [Gambler's ruin simulation in RShiny](https://bobwooster.shinyapps.io/gamblers_ruin/)

![](https://github.com/bobwooster/bobwooster.github.io/raw/main/images/gamblers_ruin.png)

* Demonstrates the probability concept of [Gambler's Ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin)
* Allows the user to adjust the probability of winning an individual game, and the starting and target bankrolls of the gambler
* Gives the probability of going broke, along with the expected number of plays before either winning or going broke
* Simulates random walks with the user-specified parameters
* Tracks proportion of times gambler wins or goes broke, and number of plays for each random walk
* Allows the user to download the simulated data
* Written as an interactive demo for a talk on [martingales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)) in 2018 and updated in 2021

## [Using tidymodels to analyze heart failure data](https://www.kaggle.com/bobwooster3/analyzing-heart-failure-data-with-the-tidyverse)

* Exploratory data analysis using `tidyverse` packages
* Built logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, and boosted tress classification models using `tidymodels`
* Compared model performance using 10-fold cross validation

## [Undamped harmonic oscillator demo in RShiny](https://bobwooster.shinyapps.io/undamped_harmonic_oscillator/)

![](https://github.com/bobwooster/bobwooster.github.io/raw/main/images/harmonic_oscillator.png)

* Created as a classroom demonstration for a differential equations class I taught
* Allows the user adjust parameters affecting the natural frequency of a spring-mass system, as well as a periodic forcing term
* The application shows the response of the system, including occurences of the phenomena of beats and resonance.
